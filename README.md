Global Study Hub - React + Tailwind landing page
==================================================

This is a minimal single-page React app (Create React App structure) with Tailwind CSS setup.
The landing page includes Hero, Visa Success, Universities, Testimonials, Why Us, and Contact sections,
a responsive navbar with mobile menu, and simple UI components.

How to run:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the dev server:
   npm start

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured, but you must run `npm install` locally for devDependencies to be installed.
- The project uses simple local UI components (src/components/ui) so no external UI library is required.
- If you want to replace the logo, add a file at src/assets/logo.png and it will be used automatically.
